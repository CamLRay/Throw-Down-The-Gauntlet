### **Name of Project:**
## *Throw down the Gauntlet*

### **Project's Purpose or Goal:**
#### The goal of Throw down the Gauntlet is to provide foam fighters with a digital solution to fighting tournament organization and running. For too long has the foam fightings scene relied on paper sign up sheets, hand drawn brackets, and tally marked scorekeeping. This is not only time consuming, but highly error prone. TDTG aims to reduce those errors and ease theb urden on trounament organizers. TDTG should reduce the number of voluteers required to run a tournament and the time it takes to manage sign-ups and preparing rounds.

### **List the absolute minimum features the project requires to meet this purpose or goal:**
* Tournament creation for popular style: 
  1. King of the hill
  2. Bracketed
      1. seeded or not
      2. single elim
      3. double elim
  3. Round Robin
  4. Swiss
  5. Hybrid(pools for seeding brackets)
* Participant Entry styles
  1. CSV (exportable from excel or google sheets)
  2. Manualy add individuals
* Automatic bracket building
* Score keeping UI
* Post tournament result calculation

### **What tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, modules and/or other resources (whatever is specific to your track, and your language) will you use to create this MVP? List them all here. Be specific.**
* React
* Redux
* JavaScript
* JSX
* HTML
* CSS
* Node.js
* Material-ui component Library

### **If you finish developing the minimum viable product (MVP) with time to spare, what will you work on next? Describe these features here: Be specific.**
* Automatic winstreak tracking
* Ring specific scorekeeping(multiple scorekeepers)
* Tournament sign up link
* Timed tournaments
* User accounts
* 1v1 ranked fighting
* Fighter Statistics
* Regional leaderboards
* Flex League support
* Mobile app support

### **What additional tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, or other resources will these additional features require?**
* TrueSkill library
* Firebase Authentication
* Firestore Database
* Express.js
* React Native

### **Is there anything else you'd like your instructor to know?**
Amtgard has a rich history of competitive foam fighting. The mvp tournaments are the most common styles run, each involving multiple brackets to be made as they are broken into brackets for different gear combinations. This is not an expansive list of tournaments.
The mvp is just , the minimum.... The full actualization of the project will take much more than the time left in the program for capstones. I plan to use this technology in my long standing hobby.
